## Syllabus ##

### Week 1: Welcome to competitive programming ###
Explore different kinds of programming competitions and benefits of participating, as well as typical rules and challenges. An overview of algorithmic programming competitions. This is an introduction to community resources and online contests.

### Week 2: Computational complexity. Linear data structures ###
An overview of computational complexity (Big O notation). Introduction to linear data structures (array, list, stack, queue): operations, complexity, implementation and examples.

### Week 3: Sorting and search algorithms ###
Binary search (implementation and examples). An overview of sorting algorithms (insertion sort, quicksort, merge sort), including theoretical analysis and examples of use. Linear sorting algorithms for integers.

### Week 4: Graph theory ###
Definition of graphs and examples of graph problems. Various ways of storing graphs in memory. Bitmask optimization. Depth First Search and related topics: connected components, detecting cycles, detecting bipartite graphs. Shortest paths: Breadth First Search, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall.

### Week 5: Contest ###
Week 5 is the final exam week. On the final exam, we will have 5 hours to solve 8 problems.
